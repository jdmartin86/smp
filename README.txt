1. Compiling examples

The library consists of .h and .hpp header files. 
It does not require compilation a priori. To 
compile the example code, go into the following
folder:

/trunk/examples/

where you can find all the examples. Type make 
in the folder that contains the particular example
you would like to execute. This should compile the 
part of the library required by that example.




2. Compiling libbot extensions

To compile the libbot extensions, go into the 
/libbot directory and type make.




3. Compiling the documentation

Make sure that you have doxygen installed. Go
into the /trunk folder and type the following:

doxygen ./doc_config/smp.doxycong
