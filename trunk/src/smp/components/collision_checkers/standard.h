      This class implements the standard collision checker. Standard collision
      checking procedure discretizes the trajectories connecting consecutive 
      states. The said trajectory is obtained by a linear interpolation between 
      the said states. Each interpolated state is, then, checked for collisioon
      with all the obstacles. This procedure is continued for all the states in 
      the trajectory. A single states is checked for collision by merely going
      through the list of obstacles to check whether the query state resides
      inside any of the obstacles.
