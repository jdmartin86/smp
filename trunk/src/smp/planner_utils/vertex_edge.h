  \brief An implementation of the vertex and edge components in the graph.
  
  Provides an implementation of the vertex and edge components in the graph. Both classes
  are defined as templates that take the types of the state, input, and the data stored in
  the vertices as well as the type of the data that is stored in the edges as an argument.

//! This parameter can be set to one for fast vertex deletion.
/*!
  The planner maintains a list of all the vertices present in the graph. If this 
  parameter is set to one, then each vertex includes a pointer to its location in
  the list, which makes vertex deletion faster. However, it introduces the overhead
  of maintaining this variable, which some users may not like. This variable should 
  be set to one when there is intense vertex deletion, e.g., when using a branch and
  bound heuristic.
